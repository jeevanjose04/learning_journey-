ACADEMIC PRESSURE
I struggled with balancing academics, extracurriculars, and a social life, which caused stress and made it hard to focus. To manage, I developed time management skills, created a study schedule, set realistic goals, and prioritized tasks. I also learned the value of taking breaks and practicing self-care to stay balanced and reduce stress.

SELF-CONFIDENCE AND BODY IMAAGE
 I struggled with self-confidence and body image, often comparing myself to others. Over time, I focused on my strengths, practiced positive self-talk, and surrounded myself with supportive people. By accepting and appreciating myself, I gained more confidence.

MY GOAL
My goal for my future startup is to create a business that addresses a specific problem or need in a unique way, using innovative solutions. I aim to build a strong, customer-centric brand, focusing on providing value and solving real-world challenges. In the long term, I want to scale the startup sustainably, prioritize a positive company culture, and use technology to drive efficiency and growth. Ultimately, I aspire to make a lasting impact while maintaining ethical business practices and fostering an environment of continuous learning and improvement.
